## OPEN ISSUES AND/OR FEATURE REQUESTS
* Add ability to do var string interpolation
* Add -v, --verbose and suppress stdout prints when not specified.
* Reconfigure -h to just show list of commands without config file example.
* Add -H to show help menu, including config file example.
* Add "s" option to Y/N prompt to skip remaining mounts and go straight to
 closing volumes. (Great for configs with MANY volumes.)
* Add config var "run_progs_pre-close" for tasks to run pre volume close.
* Add config var "run_progs_post-close" for tasks to run post volume close.
* Graceful error when config file not present.
* Refactor mount_volumes(). Too large.
